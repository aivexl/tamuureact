This command will prompt you to confirm the migrations you are about to apply.
Confirm that you would like to proceed. After applying, a backup will be captured.

The progress of each migration will be printed in the console.

When running the apply command in a CI/CD environment or another non-interactive
command line, the confirmation step will be skipped, but the backup will still be
captured.

If applying a migration results in an error, this migration will be rolled back,
and the previous successful migration will remain applied.
